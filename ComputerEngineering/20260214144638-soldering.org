1) lock your joint in place
   1. helping hands / soldering splint
   2. tape
   3. bending the leads on the other side so the circuit piece stays in place
2) clean your soldering iron
   1. remove old solder
3) Apply head and solde
   1) Apply heat evenly and melt solder onto joint
   2) apply iron to one side and then feed solder to the other
   3) dont put solder onto the iron
   4) the amount of time it takes for the joint to heat varies
   5) Make as much contact as possibe between iron and the joint
      1) hold the edge of the iron against the joint
         1) not just the tip
   6) Sometimes you can put a bit of solder on the iron to bride the airgap
      1) like you soldered cables with multiple iron fibers
   7) Remove the solder and then the iron
   8) let the joint cool
4) Inspect the joint
   1) even distribution of solder
   2) is the joint smooth and shiny?
   3) On a circuitboard
      1) should make a volcano shape
      2) should adhere to both the circuit pad and the component lead
      3) trim leads if needed

 * solder wick for desoldering
 * flux for better adherance
 * fume hood
 * solder
   * lead free or with lead (yes, actual lead)
