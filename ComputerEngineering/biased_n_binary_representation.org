* Biased-N Binary Representation

When comparing the size of binary numbers, then it of course depends on which representation you are looking at. Since this


The base idea is just shifting the whole number line down by -N. So range changes from -N to 2^n-1-N.

** Converting Decimal to Biased-128 (8 bits)
0000.0000 = -N
1111.1111 = 2^n-1-N.


1. add N to decimal value
2. Convert as if unsigned

alternatively:
1. turn the number into binary
2. add N (127) to it

   
To do the reverse, you just:
1. Convert to decimal as if unsigned
2. Subtract N
