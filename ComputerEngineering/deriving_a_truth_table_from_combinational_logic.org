* Deriving a Truth Table from Combinational Logic

To create a Truthtable for 4 Variables, you can do the following:
Given all possible values of nibbles in binary, you can conclude that in the MSB place, half of them start with 0 and half of them start with 1.
For the next lower place its 4x0 followed by 4x1.
Then alternating 2x0 and 2x1 and then just alternating 0 and 1.
This gives you every possble combination.

| A | D | M | G |   | D+M | A\cdot(D+M) | A\cdot(D+M) + G |
