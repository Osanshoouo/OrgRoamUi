* Sum-Of-Products Expressions

Is the AND-Gate version of [[id:d9ccb2a9-7a6e-4c44-8ca8-6710a126d6b0][Product-of-Sums Expressions]]

** Truthtable to SoP
Truthtable: only true if there are exactly 2 1's or 0's next to each other. The x_0 to x_3 are isolating all of these ones. Since you can create an AND gate to get outputs that are only true / 1 for a single combination, you can now do that for every x.

| A | B | C |   | x |   | x_0 | x_1 | x_2 | x_3 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |   | 0 |   |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |   | 1 |   |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |   | 0 |   |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   | 1 |   |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |   | 1 |   |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |   | 0 |   |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |   | 1 |   |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |   | 0 |   |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |

\begin{math}
\( X_0 &= \overline{A}\overline{B}C  \) \\
\( X_1 &= \overline{A}BC \) \\
\( X_2 &= A \overline{B} \overline{C} \) \\
\( X_3 &= AB \overline{C}\) \\
\end{math}

As the name implies, you then take the Sum of these Products (and simplify)

\begin{displaymath}

\begin{equation*}
 X_0 + X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3} \\
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\overline{A} \; \overline{B}C + \overline{A}BC + A \overline{B} \; \overline{C} &+ AB \overline{C}\) \\
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{align*}
X = \overline{A} \cdot C \cdot (\overline{B} + B) &+ \\
&+ A\overline{C} (\overline{B} + B)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
X = \overline{A}C \cdot 1 + A \overline{C} \cdot 1
\end{align*}


\begin{align*}
X = \overline{A}C + A \overline{C}
\end{align*}


\end{displaymath}


*This is the Sum of Products (SOP)*

** SoP to truthtable
\( X = \overline{A} B \overline{C} + \overline{B} \overline{C} + C  \)

Since the two AND Gates and the C wire go into the OR gate, if any of those gates is Active, the circuit is active.
So the only case where the Circuit outputs 0 is when C and Both the AND gates output 0.

Now you can use the AND to Truth table conversion. The first Product just gives 1 in the line where A=0 B=1 and C=0. The same goes for the other products, so we just write those down. Then we just combine them (with OR) to get the output.

| A | B | C |   | Output (OR of products) | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 (just C) |
|---+---+---+---+-------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |   |                       1 |         0 |         1 |                  0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |   |                       1 |         0 |         0 |                  1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |   |                       1 |         1 |         0 |                  0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   |                       1 |         0 |         0 |                  1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |   |                       1 |         0 |         1 |                  0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |   |                       1 |         0 |         0 |                  1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |   |                       0 |         0 |         0 |                  0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |   |                       1 |         0 |         0 |                  1 |

This Circuit has a single 0. So this is them same as \( \overline{A} + \overline{B} + C\). So just an or Gate with these 3 inputs, which is a lot more simple than the one above.

*** Appyling DeMorgan's Theorem

Due to De Morgans' Theorem:
[[file:/home/steve/OrgVault/images/computerEnginnering/de_morgans_theorem_example_circuit.png]]


we can replace the or and AND Gates with the faster NAND Gate, making the circuit faster and more efficient:
