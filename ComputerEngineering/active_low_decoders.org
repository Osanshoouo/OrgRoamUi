* Active Low Decoders

[[id:fdaf86b9-6e08-488f-bc51-e9d6a6ef05d9][Active Low]]

An example of this is the Active low AND Gate, which is just a NAND gate. Since the AND gate is used to identify unique siuations, you can get certain unique outputs like so:


| A | B | A \cdot \not B | \not(A \cdot \not B) |
|---+---+---------+------------|
| 0 | 0 |       0 |          1 |
| 0 | 1 |       0 |          1 |
| 1 | 0 |       1 |          0 |
| 1 | 1 |       0 |          1 |

You can just choose which input you want to isolate. This is A decoder:

A = 1
B = 1
C = 0
D = 0

\( X = A \cdot B \cdot \overline{C} \cdot \overline{D} \)

If you have more inputs, you can use the [[id:d9ccb2a9-7a6e-4c44-8ca8-6710a126d6b0][Product-of-Sums Expressions]] to get a more complex active low decoder
