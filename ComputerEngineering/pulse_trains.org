* Pulse Trains
rising edge (going from logic 1 to logic 0)
falling edge (going from logic 1 to logic 0)

in digital signal:
the bump intself is a potive going pulse (since it has a leading rising edge)

[[file:/home/steve/OrgVault/images/computerEnginnering/digital_signal_basic.png]]


 * periodic pulse train
   * predictable if given
     * period (T)
       * senconds / cycle
       * cyle as in:
	 * time between consequtive rising or consequtive falling edges
     * pulse width (t_w)
       * how much "width" the pulse takes up in each period


 The computers [[id:887d7ea4-5c77-4450-a8a3-c1ded334a59c][Systems Clock]] in an example of that. The Frequency of the Processor is given in (Hertz = cycles / second)

Period = seconds / cycle
Frequency = cycles / second

thus

\( frequency = \frac{1}{T} \)

** Example

\( 3.2GHz = 3.2 * 10^9 Hz \)
\(period = \frac{1}{3.2GHz = 3.2 * 10^9 Hz} = 3.125\cdot 10^{-10} \sec\)
