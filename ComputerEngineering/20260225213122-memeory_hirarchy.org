Food / Milk example.
Go to fridge first, not the storage in the back, because it further away. But storage is bigger and has a better chance of containing the milk. 

The further you go down, the longer it takes, but the more likely to have what you want. Next stop would be the grocery store. Might take a bit to get there, but its super likely to be there.
