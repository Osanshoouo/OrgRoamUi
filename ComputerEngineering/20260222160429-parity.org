* Parity
Parity is an important tool for error detection and connection. 
A lot of thing can change data. Even just electromagnetic waves in the air.

Setting one bit of Parity for error checking. For example using ASCII. Since it uses 7 bits but sends a byte, you can use the left over bit for Parity.

However Parity cannot detect an error if an even number of bitflips occour.

* Types of Parity

** Error Checking
Odd:  Sum of 1's in data  + parity is always odd (output of NXOR on all inputs)
Even: Sum of 1's in data + parity is always even (output of XOR on all inputs)

** Not useful for error checking
Mark: Parity = 1
Space: Parity = 0
