* Error Syndrome
We have a set of data bits and a set of parity bits. From the Data bits we create the P\prime bits. We then XOR the P and P\prime bits:
 * if there is exactly one bit is a 1 in the Syndrome then a parity bit was flipped
 * if two bits are 1, then a data bit was flipped

We generate the Parity bit by Using XOR on different combinations of Databits. However in those Parity bits, the cant be two Bits sharing the same group membership.

P_0 = D_0 \oplus D_1 \oplus D_3
P_1 = D_1 \oplus D_2 \oplus D_3
P_2 = D_0 \oplus D_2 \oplus D_3


| S_2 | S_1 | S_0 | Error    |
|----+----+----+----------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 | no error |
|  0 |  0 |  1 | P_0       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 | P_1       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 | D_1       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 | P_2       |
|  1 |  0 |  1 | D_0       |
|  1 |  1 |  0 | D_2       |
|  1 |  1 |  1 | D_3       |

From this table you could also derive how the Parity bits should be created in turn.
