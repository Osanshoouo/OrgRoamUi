** Bit Shifting as Multipliation and Division
Multiplication

3   = 0000 0011
6   = 0000 0110
12  = 0000 1100
24  = 0001 1000
48  = 0011 0000
96  = 0110 0000
192 = 1100 0000

This just moves the number to the left. This is a way to do multiplication with a left and right bit-shift.

So if you want
a = a * 16;

then the that is the same as
a=a<<4;

Division

Divigion is just the other way around
b = b/8;

is the same as
b= b>>3;

this is exactly what enables [[id:a7931ebc-e9ec-428b-b081-03ba37b971b9][Converting Numbers between Bases]]
