* Duty Cycle
** Definition
The Duty Cycle gives the Percentage of time a periodic pulse train = 1 (logic)

\( duty \; cycle = \frac{frequency_{}}{Period} \times 100 \% \)
\( duty \; cycle = \frac{t_{w}}{T} \times 100 \% \)

Since its unitless You can not calculate the frequecy from the Duty Cycle

Extra: The use of duty cycle for output control is called pulse width modulation or PWM.

** LED Example
An LED is a binary device, that means it cant actually dim down. What actually happens is that the Duty Cycle of the led just goes down.
