A multiplexer is a digital circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line.

That means a multiplexer takes Multiple inputs and selectively forwards them to one output. It can be built with 2 not gates, 4 and gates and one or gate:

Multiplexers optimize the use of transmission lines in communications, reducing the complexity and cost of digital systems.
