* Unicode Code Points
Unicode Code points, or rather Unicode itself is not actual Encoding. Its just the one-to-one mapping of symbols to Identifiers / binary patters.


0 \to 0x10FFFF different Code Points to assing.


They are usually represented like so:
U+hex_value

for example U+0041 \to 'A'


An example of an Encoding Scheme is [[id:bbfff7ce-5d24-4426-8a08-113e5f2a2e5a][UTF-8]].
