A programmable logic array (PLA) is a kind of programmable logic device used to implement combinational logic circuits. The PLA has a set of programmable AND gate planes, which link to a set of programmable OR gate planes, which can then be conditionally complemented to produce an output. It has 2N AND gates for N input variables, and for M outputs from the PLA, there should be M OR gates, each with programmable inputs from all of the AND gates. This layout allows for many logic functions to be synthesized in the sum of products canonical forms.
